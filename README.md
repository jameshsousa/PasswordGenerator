## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Generate a password based on the selected inclusion options
- Copy the generated password to the computer's clipboard
- See a strength rating for their generated password
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to create an interactive password generator using JavaScript algorithms. The main features of this project are as follows:

1. Generating a password based on user-selected options: This functionality was achieved by using a JavaScript algorithm that takes user input for password preferences, such as length, character types (upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters), and then creates a random password accordingly. The algorithm ensures that the password meets the specified criteria while maintaining randomness to maximize security.

2. Copying the generated password to the clipboard: This feature allows users to easily copy their newly generated password to their computer's clipboard, streamlining the process of using the generated password in other applications. This functionality was implemented using JavaScript's Clipboard API, which provides a simple interface to interact with the clipboard.

3. Displaying a password strength rating: The password generator also evaluates the strength of the generated password based on its length and character complexity. The JavaScript algorithm calculates the password strength using metrics such as entropy and then provides a visual representation of the password's strength, helping users understand the security implications of their chosen password.

4. Implementing hover and focus states for interactive elements: To improve the user experience, all interactive elements on the page were given hover and focus states. This was achieved by using CSS for styling and JavaScript event listeners to detect when an element is being hovered or focused. These states provide visual feedback to the user, indicating which elements are clickable and helping them navigate the interface more easily.

Overall, this project not only taught me how to create a practical and user-friendly password generator but also provided valuable insights into working with JavaScript algorithms and various web technologies to create interactive and dynamic web pages.
